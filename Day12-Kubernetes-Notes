In kubernetes the code is written in YAML

YAML : YAML aint a Markup language

The files in which we will write kubernetes code are called as Object definition file or Manifest files

These files will have extensions as .yml or .YAML

Yaml is not a programming language, it is not a scripting langauge

It is just a method of saving data in a file.
It is like JSON or XML.

How do we save data in YAML:

Syntax-

key: value

key is genrally provided to you by the tool
value is given by user or by tool
Indentation is important in YAML
YAML is declarative in nature.

We can save any kind of data like String, Integer, decimal value, date, boolean, alphanumerical value
Yaml file can start with --- and end with ... , however they are not mandatory to be use din YAML file
We cna validaye YAMl code written by us using YAML linit which is available online


Example 1: YAML code saving single value:

---

Hours: 36
...

Example 2: YAML code saving multiple values or list of values

---
company: Edureka
Trainings:

  - Ravi
  - Preeti
  - Jack
Timings: ["8.30PM","7.00AM","8.00AM:]
Days: 
  - Weekdays
